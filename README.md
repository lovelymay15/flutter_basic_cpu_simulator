# Basic CPU Simulator

A simple CPU–Memory–Instruction Set simulator that demonstrates how a computer executes instructions through the **Fetch–Decode–Execute cycle**. The system provides an interactive graphical interface that allows users to visualize how data moves between registers and memory while performing basic CPU operations.

## Features

- 3 CPU Registers (R1, R2, R3)
- 10 Memory Addresses (A1–A10) with user input
- Basic Instruction Set:
  - LOAD – Memory → Register
  - STORE – Register → Memory
  - ADD – R1 + R2 → R3
  - SUB – R1 − R2 → R3
- Operation history logging
- Responsive and interactive GUI

---

## Purpose

This project helps illustrate fundamental Computer Architecture and Organization concepts, including:

- Register and memory interaction
- Instruction execution
- Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Fetch–Decode–Execute cycle

\* Developed as a final project for the Computer Architecture and Organization (CAO) course, 2024.
